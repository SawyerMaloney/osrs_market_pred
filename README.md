# Trying to make an OSRS market predictor
By Sawyer Maloney | sawyerdmaloney@gmail.com

### Steps
1. Get a lot of data in as small an increment as possible (5m increments thus far)
2. Make predictions

### TODO
1. Make it predict well
2. Consider changing hyperparameters like timespan of prediction (hour long data, etc.)
3. Add more rnn layers to consider different factors like volume, low/high price
4. Serialize the model
5. Some function to test after training, preferrably showing loss as well as how much money we would make or loss
